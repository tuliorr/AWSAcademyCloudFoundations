# AWS Academy Cloud Foundations

## Module 1 - Cloud Concepts Overview

### Section 1 - Introduction to Cloud Computing

* Cloud computing presents infrastructure as software rather than infrastructure as hardware.

  * Infrastructure as a software: flexible, pay-as-you-go, low initial cost, focus on business and customers

  * Infrastructure as a hardware: acquisition, provision and maintenance = high cost

* Types of cloud computing

  * Infrastructure as a Service `IaaS` : basic building blocks

  * Platform as a Service `PaaS` : manage hardware and operating systems

  * Software as a Service `SaaS` : complete product that is run and managed by the service provider

* Deployment models

  * `Cloud` : A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud

  * `Hybrid` : A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud

  * `On-premises` : Deploying resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes called “private cloud” (similar to traditional physical infrastructure)
